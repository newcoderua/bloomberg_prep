3. who are the competitors of bloomberg?
Bloomberg (company) is a massive conglomeration of businesses so difficult to pinpoint a subset of competitors. It's core business has always been its' Terminals and Thomson Reuters is the most natural competitor in this space (with products like Kobra, Eikon, D3000). The Terminal business is all about a fantastic technological platform that delivers comprehensive financial information. There are sector specific competitors like Dow Jones Industrial Average FX Trader that have been improving as well. Technically, Google/Yahoo finance would be part of this subset as well.
